# Ethan Krchnak AVL Trees Details

## Values
- 10, 20, 30, 15, 25, 5, 35, 27

## Steps
1. Insert the first 3 values: 10, 20, 30.
   - Right-heavy subtree, causing a left rotation.
   - The tree is balanced with a 0 balance factor on branches.

2. Continue adding values: 15, 25, 5, 35, 27.
   - No further rotations are needed as the final tree is balanced.

## Result
- The fixed tree now allows for smoother, more efficient search operations in O(log n) time.
